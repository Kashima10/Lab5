                <h3>Chris' Album 1</h3>
                <p>11:11 is as good as expected – Chris Brown lives up to the hype. On this album, or at least half of it, the singer retrocedes to his true essence. Songs like “Messed Up,” the intro “Angel Numbers/Ten Toes,” or “No One Else” with Maeta unlocks emotions that only a good “singy-sing” type of R&B album evokes.</p>

                <h3>Rihanna's Album 2</h3>
                <p>ANTI is a fun and conflicted pop record, at its most interesting when it's at its smallest and most idiosyncratic. If the album has a narrative arc, it's about disappointment: the ways in which the people you trust can still come up short in the end, and how lonesome that can feel.</p>

                <h3>Raye's Album 3</h3>
                <p>My 21st Century Blues. <br>
                    British singer-songwriter RAYE’s debut album “My 21st Century Blues” arrives just months after her chart-topping single “Escapism.” Though this is her first album, she is in no way new to the music industry. Signed to Polydor Records from 2014 to 2021, she wrote tracks for Beyoncé, Ellie Goulding, and John Legend, also collaborating with EDM artists like David Guetta and Joel Corry. Newly independent from her label, RAYE is now taking advantage of her newfound creative control to craft the music she wants to make. As she fuses elements of blues and synth-pop with her own style, RAYE channels her rage, trauma, and frustrations into the candid and beautifully juxtaposed record.
